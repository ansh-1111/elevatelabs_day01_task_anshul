Day 01 Task - Elevate Labs Internship
This project's objective was to perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the "Mall Customer Segmentation Data" dataset to prepare it for analysis and modeling. The raw data was accessed directly from a GitHub URL using Python's Pandas library.

The following cleaning steps were executed:

Missing Values and Duplicates: Checked for missing values and duplicates. The dataset was found to have no missing entries or duplicate rows, confirming its high initial data quality.

Column Renaming: Renamed the columns "Annual Income (k$) " and "Spending Score (1-100)" to "Annual_Income" and "Spending_Score" for easier readability and more consistent coding practices.

Data Types and Standardization: Verified that the data types for each column were correct. Text values in the 'Gender' column were standardized to a consistent format.

The cleaned dataset is now structured and ready for further exploratory data analysis and the application of machine learning algorithms for customer segmentation.
